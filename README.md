# WirelessFireless

## What is this

This is a spin of inSSIDer-2 with the following feature differences:

 * Name changed
 * Solution and project ported forwards to VS 2015
 * .Net target changed to 4.5.2
 * Installer removed (not compatible with new VS)
 * Auto-updater removed (because it depended on Metageek server)
 * News tab removed (because it depended on Metageek RSS)
 * Metageek and Donate buttons covered up (they could not be fully removed)
 * In the git repo, the `ManagedWifi` and `IoCtlNdis` submodules have been flattened into local code.
 
There should be no serious functionality differences! 

## Download the program

You can just download a [zip of the WirelessFireless program][1] if that's what you want.

## Enjoy
